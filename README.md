Predicting and Analyzing Urban Water Quality Using IBM Watson Machine Learning Service.

Aim of the project is to predict the quality of the water in urban areas according to the
sample data given. Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human
health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for people living in urban areas. Quality
of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and
control of waterborne diseases. However, predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task
since the water quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such
as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses, so this project aims at building a Machine
Learning (ML) model to Predict Water Quality by considering all water quality standard
indicators.
